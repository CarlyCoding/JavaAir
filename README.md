This was an assignment to model a system for an airline with Java, using classes for Passengers, Cabin Crew, Pilots, and Planes. The classes were used to compile a flight which would have a plane, cabin crew, list of passengers etc. 

TDD was used to ensure all classes etc. were correct and functional.
